# Odoo in docker

Dockerized version of Odoo for development and debugging.
You will need `docker-compose` for this to run or `vscode` to develop inside
a container.

## Starting...

Let's start by generating required files, run:
`scripts/generate.sh` with either *devcontainer* or *compose* argument.
It will generate the *.env* file, *docker-compose.override.yaml* and
launcher configuration.
You should edit the compose override file for the mounts you want.

```shell
# start up odoo and the database
docker-compose up -d

# connect and run things on the containers
docker-compose exec odoo bash
docker-compose exec db psql -U odoo -l

# copy files to and from the container
docker copy myfile.tar dockerodoo-odoo-1:/
```

Since the default configuration is set to connect to odoo, you can run
commands inside the odoo container without specifying most parameters.

``` shell
# run the shell
odoo-bin shell

# connect to the database
psql
```

```

## The Dockerfile

Starting from [odoo-docker], add development tools
and a user for development with the same UID as yourself.

## vscode: devcontainer

[Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

Inside the devcontainer, the user is *vscode* with uid=$DEV_UID.
The same image is used for compose and devcontainer.

File locations:
- The workspace is mounted at `/odoo-workspace`
- ODOO_EXTRA_ADDONS=`/odoo-workspace/custom`
- ODOO_BASEPATH=`/opt/odoo`
- ODOO_BASE_ADDONS=`/opt/odoo-addons`

# Development and Testing

## Cloning odoo

If you want to use your own odoo sources, you must clone the `odoo`
repository to a folder of your choosing outside of this repository.
That repository is quite big and can be shared among projects.
By default, we expect the odoo directory next to your project directory;
if not check the configuration files.

```shell
ODOO_SOURCE=git@github.com:odoo
git clone $ODOO_SOURCE/odoo.git
mkdir odoo-addons
# optionally clone what you need (example)
cd odoo-addons
git clone $ODOO_SOURCE/design-themes.git
git clone $ODOO_SOURCE/enterprise.git
```

Add the path in the *docker-comopse.override.yaml* file.

## Modes

Run `./scripts/generate.sh` when changing modes.
It will adapt the launch configuration, and generate default files which
are `.env` and `docker-compose.override.yaml`.
If you use local odoo sources, mount them in the compose override file.

- *devcontainer* as the name indicates, it is for working inside a container
  - `.devcontainer/vscode.code-workspace` is a workspace with odoo sources
- *compose* supposes that you run `docker-compose` and debug remotely
  - `.vscode/odoo.code-workspace` is to be used when you have local odoo sources

## Linting

A simple script `pre-commit` is there to lint the code before committing.
You can install it as a hook or run manually with `./pre-commit lint` if you
want the full checks.

## Backup and restore database

You can restore the database from a dump.
After restoring the database, you might want to run the *reset* command
to set the password and check system properties.
The password is set to "admin" for all users.

	# env
	source .env
	DB_TEMPLATE=dump

	# load the dump
	dropdb --if-exists "$DB_TEMPLATE" && createdb "$DB_TEMPLATE"
	psql "$DB_TEMPLATE" < dump.sql

	# create your copy
	scripts/reset-db.sh "$DB_NAME" "$DB_TEMPLATE"

## Running tests

```shell
# inside the devcontainer
odoo-test -t -a template_module -d test_db_1
# which is similar to
odoo --test-enable --stop-after-init -i template_module -d test_db_1

# using docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.test.yaml run --rm odoo
```
